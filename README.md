## About The Project

This project born from my personal study of Android Document Providers.

I needed to expose some files in a real application, but at the time of launch of Android api 30, begun to be mandatory to implement as Content Providers instead just use java IO.

So, this is a very simple way to expose some files to others applications (as 'Documents').
